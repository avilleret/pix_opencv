updated for Linux on 2012-09-12


get the source version through svn :

svn co https://pure-data.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pure-data pure-data
cd pure-data/trunk/externals/pix_opencv

===== GNU/Linux ===== 

(actually only tested in GNU/Linux Ubuntu)
this new version requiered OpenCV 2.3, available with apt-get since 12.04

apt-get install libopencv-dev

for other systems, you must build the lib from source, see this :
http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide

get the _SOURCES_ of the pd you are using
and of the GEM that you are loading
( it might not work if the version
is different )

cd into the package folder :

  cd pix_opencv

configure the package with the appropriate command for your system :

  ./configure --with-pd=<path to pd _sources_> --with-gem=<path to gem _sources_>

for example :

./configure --with-pd=/usr/local/pd --with-gem=/usr/local/pd/gem

then, compile it :

make clean
make

and put the *.pd_linux and *.pd files somewhere in Pd's path.  You can add the
current directory to the pd search path through Media->Preferences->Path


===== MAC OSX (intel and powerPC) =====


first install openCV MacOS framework 
   download openCV private framework from http://www.ient.rwth-aachen.de/cms/software/opencv/
   copy the provided OpenCV.framework folder in your /Library/Frameworks/ directory ::
	cp -Rf /Volumes/OpenCV\ Private\ Framework/OpenCV.framework /Library/Frameworks/
