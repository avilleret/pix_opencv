===== GNU/Linux ===== 

(actually only tested in GNU/Linux Ubuntu)

first install opencv development packages,
on ubuntu :

apt-get install libcv-dev
apt-get install libcvaux-dev
apt-get install libhighgui-dev

get the _SOURCES_ of the pd you are using
and of the GEM that you are loading
( it might not work if the version
is different )

cd into the package folder :

  cd pix_opencv

configure the package with the appropriate command for your system :

  ./configure --with-pd=<path to pd _sources_> --with-gem=<path to gem _sources_>

for example :

./configure --with-pd=/usr/local/pd --with-gem=/usr/local/pd/gem

then, compile it :

make clean
make

and put the *.pd_linux and *.pd files somewhere in Pd's path.  You can add the
current directory to the pd search path through Media->Preferences->Path
