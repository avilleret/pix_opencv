`pix_opencv` is a Puredata library for real-time video processing : blob tracking, contours extracting, motion flow computation... It is based on work by Yves Degoyon and Lluis Gomez i Bigorda and uses `OpenCV` and `Gem`

I'm trying to improve `pix_opencv` library since 2012. I add new objects as needed in my projects.

`pix_opencv` is open and you can find the sources here : https://github.com/avilleret/pix_opencv

You can also find binaries for Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X here : https://github.com/avilleret/pix_opencv/releases
For more informations, please check the Wiki : https://github.com/avilleret/pix_opencv/wiki
Please report bugs through Github interface : https://github.com/avilleret/pix_opencv/issues

Also you can start with `pix_opencv-overview.pd` which shows all availalbe objects.
Each external has also its own help file.
There are severals examples also the `examples` folder.

To use `pix_opencv` in your project, add the folder to the pd search path.
